         In this about page, you will know some of the things I do. I was born in June 20, 2002 at Pumwani Maternity
         Hospital.Raised in a christian house hold with both parents. My journey of education started at Riruta
         Satellite Academy located in Dagoretti. I studied and acquired knowledge there. Late 2012, we relocated from 
         Dagoretti to Embakasi,Utawala. I had to transfer to another school by the name Brightlight Academy where i 
         studied for a while.Transferred to a new school(2014) called Embakasi Benedicta Academy and sat for my KCPE(2015).
         I did fairly well and i was called to join <!--an extra county school--> St. Thomas Aquinas High School,located
         in makadara along jogoo road(2016).There is where i perfected my social,spiritual,academic skills.i did my KCSE
         (2019).Life had to begin and there i was selling groceries,food,beverages and snacks back home in our estate.
         Within that period i went for a short course(computer packages) at<a href="https://www.kim.ac.ke"> Kenya Institute
         of Management</a>,in Utawala.I was able to get a driving license and life seemed to be moving on well. Early 2021,
         I was able to join <a href="https://www.zetech.ac.ke">Zetech University</a> is where my dream of becoming a programmer
         came to life.I always had a passion to be a developer, i watched hacking,technology movies e.t.c. In Zetech,I got skills,
         drive and urge to chase after my dream to better my future and that of my family and positively impact our generation today.
         All i can say is, that being a software and web developer has been and is still fun.Apart from coding and stuff, i play football,
         i love socializing ,i beatbox,i game<!--fifa-->,i love travelling, i love driving and many other outdoor activities.My credits to God,
         my able mother,my lectures,my colleagues,my classmates and my supportive friends.Lovely!!!!!!
